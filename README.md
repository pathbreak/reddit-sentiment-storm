# Reddit Comments Sentiment Analysis Topology for Apache Storm

## Overview

This project implements a sentiment analyzer Storm topology for Reddit comments. It demonstrates how Storm can be used
for realtime mining of high velocity data streams.

Given a list of [subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/reddits/), the topology polls the RSS feeds of each subreddit
every 30 secs, updates comment counts and calculates sentiment scores for comments, and publishes the results to
the cluster's associated Zookeeper server/cluster at the znode path "/reddit". 

The _Viewer App_ subscribes to the same Zookeeper server/cluster, monitors changes to "/reddit", and displays the results
whenever they change. 


** Sentiment Calculation: **
  
The sentiment score calculation is a very naive one - simply sum up 
[AFINN](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6010) scores 
of all words in each comment. 

There is no machine learning or statistical model implemented here, but implementing one should 
be fairly straightforward using Trident ML. 

See [SentimentCalculatorBolt](../blob/master/src/main/java/storm/redditsentiment/SentimentCalculatorBolt.java) for 
calculation implementation.



## Usage

### Deploy the topology to a Storm cluster

- Download `redditsentiment-cluster-all.jar` to any node of the Storm cluster.

	```bash
	
    $ wget https://github.com/pathbreak/reddit-sentiment-storm/releases/download/release-1.0.0/redditsentiment-cluster-all.jar

	```
	
    
   
- Start the topology using this command line:

	```bash
	
    $ storm jar redditsentiment-cluster-all.jar storm.redditsentiment.RedditSentimentTopology <subreddit-1> <subreddit-2> ...
    
	```
	
  Example:

	```bash
	
    $ storm jar redditsentiment-cluster-all.jar storm.redditsentiment.RedditSentimentTopology worldnews technology science
    
	```
	
### View Results 

The topology publishes 3 lists:

- Top 5 most commented stories across all given subreddits

- Top 5 stories with most positive comments across all given subreddits

- Top 5 stories with most negative comments across all given subreddits

Run the _Viewer App_ to monitor these lists in realtime:

- Download `redditsentiment-viewer.jar` to a machine which can access the Zookeeper server/cluster.

	```bash
	
    $ wget https://github.com/pathbreak/reddit-sentiment-storm/releases/download/release-1.0.0/redditsentiment-viewer.jar
    
	```
	
- Find out the IP address and port of Zookeeper server or any node of the Zookeeper cluster.
  Examine the Storm cluster's `conf/storm.yaml` for these settings. 
  The Zookeeper port is usually 2181 for a standalone Zookeeper node, or 2000 for Storm's embedded Zookeeper node 
  when running in local mode.
  
- Run the _Viewer App_:
	
	```bash
	
    $ java -jar redditsentiment-viewer.jar [IP-ADDRESS-OF-ZOOKEEPER-NODE] [PORT-OF-ZOOKEEPER-DAEMON]
    
	```
	

### Test the topology on a local Storm cluster

It's possible to test the topology in Storm's local cluster mode on a development machine.

- Download `redditsentiment-local-all.jar` to development machine.

    $ wget https://github.com/pathbreak/reddit-sentiment-storm/releases/download/release-1.0.0/redditsentiment-local-all.jar
    
    
- Start the local Storm harness and topology using this command line:

	```bash
	
    $ java -jar redditsentiment-local-all.jar LOCAL <subreddit-1> <subreddit-2> ...
    
	```
- Run the _Viewer App_ as described in [View Results](View Results), giving `localhost` and `2000` as Zookeeper host and port.
 


## Build

+ Install Apache Maven2/3

+ Clone this repo:
	
	```bash
	$ git clone https://github.com/pathbreak/reddit-sentiment-storm.git
	
	$ cd reddit-sentiment-storm
	``` 

+ `reddit-sentiment-storm$ mvn clean package`
	
+ 3 JARs are produced under `reddit-sentiment-storm/dist` directory:

   + **redditsentiment-cluster-all.jar**
     
     This JAR is suitable for deploying on a Storm cluster.  

   + **redditsentiment-local-all.jar**
     
     This JAR is for testing the topology in a standalone Storm harness on your development machine. See [Usage](Usage).  

   + **redditsentiment-viewer.jar**
     
     This is the Viewer console app JAR to display results of the analysis.  See [Usage](Usage).
